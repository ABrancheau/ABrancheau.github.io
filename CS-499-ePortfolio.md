# Professional Self-Assessment

Since starting work on my bachelor’s at Southern New Hampshire University after receiving my associates degree at Nashua Community College, I have learned much throughout the program. In most of the programming related courses
I learned about the importance of planning development, use of industry standards, and proper testing. In DAD-220 I worked with the relational database MySQL, then in CS-330 and CS-465 I worked with the non-relational MongoDB.
It was in that CS-465 that I learned how to work with the full MEAN stack to build a web application through the Travlr Getaways website, complete with an administrator single page application (SPA) for managing the site.
CS-305, CS-405, and CS-410 all emphasized the importance of security, focusing on known vulnerabilities,zero trust, and reverse engineering to aid in building secure programs. Thanks to my coursework, I have gained experience 
working with Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript, providing me with a more well-rounded skillset for programming in a variety of languages. CS-225, -230, and –250 provided me with a greater understanding of the software
development lifecycle and what work is expected of each team member, how they work together, and helped shape my career goals towards becoming a programmer as compared to a software developer or simple coder. CS-225 in
particular focused on the importance of communicating with stakeholders through regular documentation. In CS-300 I worked with a variety of data structures including vectors, linked lists, hash tables, and binary trees, and 
sorting algorithms like quick sort and selection sort. 

The artifact I built on for my enhancements was the Grazioso Salvare Animal Rescue program from IT-145: Foundation in Application Development, which I took in my fourth term at SNHU back in 2023. The program was a console 
application for adding, viewing, and reserving rescue animals for service around the world. The original program was written in Java, used hard coded data storage for the rescue animals, and lacked any search or sorting 
functionality, making it ideal for the enhancements. Rebuilding the program as a web application using primarily JavaScript, adding a MongoDB database to store the animal data and user credentials, and adding a merge sort
algorithm allowed me to use the same artifact for each enhancement and demonstrate my ability to meet each of the course outcomes.
